# How the Little Jupyter Notebook Became a Web App: Managing Increasing Complexity with nbdev


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

> Already familiar with ipywidgets, but ready to take your skills to the next level? In this tutorial we walk through what it takes to transform an exploratory Jupyter Notebook into a mature web application. Web apps can be a valuable product of collaboration between researchers and software developers, and the packages used in this tutorial were selected to support this relationship, starting with using JupyterLab as an integrated development environment. Attendees will learn how to design and document a scientific web application that accommodates increasing complexity, but is also inheritable by the researchers who maintain them in the long run.

This is a live in-perosn tutorial hosted at the SciPy2023 conference in Austin, TX. It will be held 07-10, 13:30–17:30 (America/Chicago), Classroom 104. 

## Prerequisites

Prior exposure to ipywidgets and/or familiarity with object-oriented
programming is recommended. We review the basics of ipywidgets within
the first hour and quickly move on to more advanced design principles.

## Binder

There are two ways to access this tutorial. You can launch these
notebooks in a Binder environment by clicking the badge below. This
requires not extra installation on your part. Just click the link and
follow along.

### How long will my Binder session last?

Binder will automatically shut down user sessions that have more than 10
minutes of inactivity (if you leave a jupyterlab window open in the
foreground, this will generally be counted as “activity”). Binder tries
to guarentee that active sessions will last up to 6 hours.

### What if my session shuts down during a break?

We will start from a fresh checkpoint after every break, so if your
Binder session ends, you can just restart a new session and the
beginning of the next section.

If you would like to run this tutorial locally on your own computer,
please follow the instructions below.

## Installation Instructions

1.  Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/nicole-brewer/scipy23-jupyter-web-app-tutorial`
2.  If you don’t have it already, you will need to [download and install
    Miniconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)
3.  Run `conda env create -f environment.yml` to create a conda
    environment called `jupyter-web-application`
4.  Run `conda activate jupyter-web-application` to activate the conda
    environment
5.  Run `jupyter lab` to launch JupyterLab

## How to use

We will follow the notebooks in the tutorial sequentially, starting with
`00_getting_started.ipynb`. We will then transition to editing notebooks
in the `nbs` directory that contains a full web application. You will be
instructed when to do so from the numbered notebooks.
